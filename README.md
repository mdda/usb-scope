The Pololu USB Programmer device includes two extra ports that can sample analog data at 10KHz.

Pololu has created a Windows-only oscilloscope utility. However, now that robotics is attracting more and more 'software types', a cross-platform version SLOscope is essential.

This project provides both a configuration utility for the USB device, and a 'wxWidgets-based' SLOscope oscilloscope GUI. While Pololu have provided some help (like hardware specs, and moral support), this is a totally independent project.

It's all cross-platform, easily buildable, and open source. Have fun!
Code Coming Soon !
