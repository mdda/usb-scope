#summary Getting user access to the USB device
= Problem =

Since the Linux kernel doesn't 'know' the Pololu device, it doesn't give regular users privileges to write to it.

= Details - and quick fix =

{{{
$ usb-programmer-config
Gives meaning-less, and inconsistent results for the HW version (for instance)
}}}

while (doing the same as root) :
{{{
# usb-programmer-config
Look different (and correct)
}}}

Check the device permissions :

{{{
# lsusb 
Bus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 004 Device 003: ID 046d:c03d Logitech, Inc. M-BT96a Pilot Optical Mouse
Bus 004 Device 002: ID 413c:2003 Dell Computer Corp. Keyboard
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 008 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 007 Device 011: ID 1ffb:0081  
Bus 007 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub

[root@madison build]# ls -l /dev/bus/usb/007/011 
crw-rw-r-- 1 root root 189, 778 2009-10-13 20:59 /dev/bus/usb/007/011

[root@madison build]# chmod 666 /dev/bus/usb/007/011 
}}}

Now : 
{{{
$ usb-programmer-config
Works beautifully...
}}}

= Details - and permanent fix  *work in progress* =

Need to create a 'udev rule' to assign the permissions when the device is plugged in.

Create a file called `/etc/udev/rules.d/65-pololu.rules` that contains :


(for Linux Ubuntu 7.10 - based on what I've read) :
{{{
# udev rules file for Pololu SLOscope USB device (for udev 0.98 version)

SUBSYSTEM!="usb_device", GOTO="pololu_rules_end"
ACTION!="add", GOTO="pololu_rules_end"

ATTRS{idVendor}=="1ffb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0081", MODE="0666"

LABEL="pololu_rules_end" 
}}}

(for Fedora 11 - this is tested, and really works) :
{{{
# udev rules file for Pololu SLOscope USB device (for udev 0.98 version)

SUBSYSTEM!="usb", GOTO="pololu_rules_end"
ACTION!="add", GOTO="pololu_rules_end"

SYSFS{idVendor}=="1ffb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="0081", MODE="0666"

LABEL="pololu_rules_end" 
}}}


Test this with : `udevtest /bus/usb/devices/7-1`, if the device is under `/dev/bus/usb/007` ...


=== Complaint ===

And, yes, I'm aware that this should be done with ConsoleKit and HAL (and / or DeviceKit).  But don't you think I would have been able to figure it out if it were documented properly ??  YMMV.
