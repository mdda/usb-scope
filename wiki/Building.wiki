#summary Building the SLOscope code

== Introduction ==

The SLOscope source was developed on a Linux box running Fedora.  However, the tools used means that it should be seamlessly buildable on each of these platforms : 

  * Linux
    * Fedora
    * Ubuntu
    * etc...
  * MacOS
  * Windows

Once you've managed to build the project on your platform (especially if it's not Linux), please let us know your experiences!  Ideally, we'll be able to host installable binaries here too, so that _regular users_ of the Windows and Mac platforms can install it quickly too.


== Building the project : Generic ==

The prerequisite for doing these steps is an installation of 'cmake'.

 # Go to the build directory : `cd build`
 # To create a suitable Makefile  v. cool), execute : `cmake ..`
   * Did you type that in correctly?  The 'cmake' is followed by space and two dots...
 # Finally, execute : `make`

To run the software, just type one of the following (still in the build directory) :
  * `usb-programmer-config`
  * `SLOscope`


=== Specific Instructions : Linux (Fedora) ===

Actually, the above works immediately.  Installing cmake needs `yum install cmake`.
