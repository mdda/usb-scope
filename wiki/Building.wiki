#summary Building the SLOscope code

= Introduction =

The SLOscope source was developed on a Linux box running Fedora.  However, the tools used means that it should be seamlessly buildable on each of these platforms : 

  * Linux
    * Fedora
    * Ubuntu
    * etc...
  * MacOS
  * Windows


= Building the project : Generic =

The prerequisite for doing these steps is an installation of 'cmake'.

 # Go to the build directory
 # execute 'cmake ..'
 # execute 'make'

To run the software, just type one of the following (in the build directory) :
  * usb-programmer-config
  * SLOscope


= Specific Instructions : Linux (Fedora) =

Actually, the above works immediately.  Installing cmake needs `yum install cmake`.
