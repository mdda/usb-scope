#summary Modifying (and hopefully improving) the software

== Modifying the GUI : Generic ==
For modifying the GUI, you'll need wxglade installed.  This has the capability of modifying the C++ source code in-place, without destroying the customisation that was developed 'on top'.

 # Launch 'wxglade src/USBconfig.wxg' or 'wxglade src/SLOscope.wxg' 
 # Generate code (don't overwrite existing code - let it update the existing)
 # Rebuild


=== Developing on Linux ===

On Fedora, to install wxGlade : `yum install wxGlade`

To build and (if successful) run in the ./build directory : 
`make && ./SLOscope`
